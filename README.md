# ILSpy

ILSpy is an open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler.

This is a forked repository. If you are looking for the original ILSpy version, you can find that over at the [main repository](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases).

What is different about this version/fork?
-------

 * Allows for whole assembly decompilation in just one click/operation
 * Automatically decompiles each class into its own seperate file (instead of one gigantic code file)
 * Automatically determines the file name for each file from the class name (no more having to save each class individually)
 * Automatically puts each class into its appropriate namespace (saving a class would do so without the namespace)
 * Adds a 'Decompile...' option to the context menu (was limited to only File->Decompile)
